Create the following node with the following label and properties

- Label: Movies
- Properties:
    - name: Kaithi

- Label: Movies
- Properties:
    - name: Master

- Label: Movies
- Properties:
    - name: Theri

- Label: Movies
- Properties:
    - name: Mersal


Once you have created nodes, I need to see all the nodes under Movies label

Along with the strategy give me the query you will use to see all the nodes.
